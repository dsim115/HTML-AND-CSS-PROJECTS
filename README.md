# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
## Introduction:
This is my repository for all the work and information I will work on during my HTML/CSS coursework.
 ### Projects:
 - The Pet Shop
 - Academy Cinemas
 - [Portfolio Website](https://dsim115.github.io/Website-Portfolio/)

### The Pet Shop
This website is one of my first complete pages, including HTML and CSS. It contains a navbar, images, a contact form, a video, and hover effects.

### Academy Cinemas
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

### Portfolio
This is my most complete website within this course. It is an overview of my software development career up to this point. It includes a Nav bar, animation, hyperlinks, and a functioning contact form.
